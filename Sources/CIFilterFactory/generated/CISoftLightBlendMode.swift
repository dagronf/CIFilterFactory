	/// Soft Light Blend Mode

	/// Either darkens or lightens colors, depending on the source image sample color. If the source image sample color is lighter than 50% gray, the background is lightened, similar to dodging. If the source image sample color is darker than 50% gray, the background is darkened, similar to burning. If the source image sample color is equal to 50% gray, the background is not changed. Image samples that are equal to pure black or pure white produce darker or lighter areas, but do not result in pure black or white. The overall effect is similar to what you would achieve by shining a diffuse spotlight on the source image.
